## Business Activities


Music from a data perspective is a plethora of audio data, which AI can process effectively. For humans musical production is laborious, especially, on the production side. However, the offloading of parts of the production to AI tools allows the artist to focus more on their creativity. Music.AI expands the musical capabilites of any artist by giving them access to more sounds, specific trackings of instruments, without having to manually do it themselves. They can utilize Music.AI to complete these tasks for them. 

Music.AI is for anybody interested in Music, Sound Engineering, and anything related to Audio processing. Record labels, agencies, technology firms, and developers our customers of Music.AI. Music.AI has over 40 million users. 

Music.AI have developed the most "extensive collection of state of the art APIs and AI audio solutions" that no one else has as one can read on their homepage. There one can see the many different modules all AI powered, which no other app or company offers as completely.

Their flagship product, the Moises App, allows users to separate vocals, drums, guitar, bass, keys, and other instruments in any song with a single click. It also offers features like pitch shifting, key detection, smart metronome, voice synthesis, and many other musical productions taks previously thought to be too arduos to complete or even near impossible.

## Landscape


Music AI is in the music production field, but of course, also anything tangential to audio processing/producing. Any audio project that a media company, advertise agency, or etc. may have, Music.AI can help them make theirs lives easier with the tools they have to offer. 

The major trends in the last decade would be the developement of high-quality producer softwares at an affordable price, such as Abelton, FruityLoops, and even Garage Band. Music.AI takes the torch from these softwares, by introducing a new era of musical and audio production software that is enhanced by AI technology. 

There are no other major players in this industry like Music.AI. They are ahead of the curve with their propietary knowledge and productions, of audio seperation for audio tracks, and other modules. *Music.ai* is the first of it's kind, with its flagship app *Moises.ai*. A few runnerups have come copying the technology, but no honorable mentions are worth sharing since Music.ai is so dominant.

## Results


The company has created a tool that is as essential to a musician as their instrument would be. Musicians have discovered that their jobs are so much easier with the moises.ai app, and its capabilites in creating multi-instrumental tracking, click-tracking, and etc. at the touch of a finger. The industry is forever changed because it now allows producers and musicians to be more creative without having to do any tedious finessing of audio tracks.

Furthermore, the company has been employed to do some odd jobs. Papa John's wanted to start an national ad campaign, employing the NBA champion Shaquile O'neal as an actor in their commercial. However, Shaquile doesn't speak spanish, so he can't really sell to spanish speaking patrons. Papa John's reached out to Music.AI after recording their commercial,  to see if the AI company could help with their AI. THey were able to reporduce Shaq's voice, and they then prompted that voice to translate the english ad into spanish. The rest is history, but also, a precedent that indicates how useful Music.AI is not just for musicians, but also, companies in need of certain audio productions.

The metrics would be the number, and type of users, utilizing the moises app. This group is 40 million stronc, which include superstars, and professional musicians, like Eloy Casagrande, new drummer of Slipknot, or Rom Gov, pro drummer of many olocal Austin and national bands. Another metric is the

## Recommendations

I'd reccomend music.ai get into the AI music generative buisness. Lots of companies utilizing AI for music are on the generative side, whether it's lyrics, or beats. I think music.ai could be more comprehensive app by creating a module that suggests or recommends audio files to the producer/musician as they produce live music or record. Music.AI could also create an AI agent or assistant that could help users of the moises.ai (their propietary app) to navigate its interface more effectively.   This could increase their user base to more amateurish music producers and musicians. This would put powerful creative tools in the hands of those who previously thought these capabilites were unimaginable.
