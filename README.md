Music from a data perspective is a plethora of audio data, which AI can process effectively. For humans musical production is laborious, especially, on the production side. However, the offloading of parts of the production to AI tools allows the artist to focus more on their creativity. Music.AI expands the musical capabilites of any artist by giving them access to more sounds, specific trackings of instruments, without having to manually do it themselves. They can utilize Music.AI to complete these tasks for them.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
The company has created a tool that is as essential to a musician as their instrument would be. Speaking to local musicians I have discovered that their jobs are so much easier with the moises.ai app, and its capabilites in creating multi-instrumental tracking, click-tracking, and etc. at the touch of a finger. The industry is forever changed because it now allows producers and musicians to be more creative without having to do any tedious finessing of audio tracks. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
The metrics would be the number, and type of users, utilizing the moises app. This group is 40 million stronc, which include superstars, and professional musicians, like Eloy Casagrande, new drummer of Slipknot, or Rom Gov, pro drummer of many olocal Austin and national bands. Another metric is the depth

## Recommendations

I'd reccomend music.ai get into the AI music generative buisness. Also, they should create an AI agent or assistant that could help users of the moises.ai app navigate and produce songs. Lots of companies utilizing AI for music are on the generative side, whether it's lyrics, or beats. I think music.ai wouldn't have a hard time creating a module that suggests or recommends audio files to the producer/musician as they play live of record. The company processes over a million audio files a day, allowing their AI to process so many different creative ideas.  could increase user base to more amateurish music producers and musicians. This would initiate a new generation of music.
